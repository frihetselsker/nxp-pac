# There are two fields generated for hc and r. hc/r has a length of 7 and is offset by 1 (so it is
# really [1..=7]). Then there is an explicit hc/r field for index 0. We want an array of length 8 
# at the correct offset.
#
# However chiptool has no way to change the length and offset of a register, so replace the register.
